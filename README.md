# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

### This is our homeowrkk assignment for the Javascript unit 

### The intention is to build a password generator using what we've learned about:
    functions
    comparisohn operators
    methods
    alerts, prompts, and confirms
    loops
    arrays
    conditional staements
    variables

## Objectives 
    create an app that randomly generates a password that meets certain criteria
        creating a strong password that provides greater security
    GIVEN I need a new, secure password...
        WHEN I click the button to generate a password
        THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

        WHEN prompted for password criteria
        THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

        WHEN prompted for the length of the password
        THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
            
        WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
        THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

        WHEN I answer each prompt
        THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected

        WHEN all prompts are answered
        THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria

        WHEN the password is generated
        THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
